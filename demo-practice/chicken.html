            <h2>My chicken Poem</h2>
            <p>
                In the farm, a clucking sound,<br>
                Feathers rustle on the ground.<br>
                A creature with wings so fine,<br>
                The chicken, oh, it's quite divine.<br>
                Feathers of gold, feathers of white,<br>
                Basking in the morning light.<br>
                Water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is life.

        <b>chickens</b> are fascinating creatures that have been domesticated for thousands of years. These feathered
        friends are known for their distinct appearance, with colorful plumage and a unique wattle and comb on their
        heads <sup><a href="https://www.google.com">[1]</a></sup>.
        They come in various breeds, each with its own characteristics and purposes.
        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <p>Chickens are not only valued for their eggs but also for their tender meat. Their meat is versatile and can
            be
            prepared in countless ways, from juicy roasted chicken to flavorful chicken curry. It's no wonder that
            chicken
            is a popular protein choice in many cuisines worldwide.</p>

        <p>When it comes to behavior, chickens are social animals that form hierarchical flocks. They communicate
            through a
            range of vocalizations, clucking and crowing to convey different messages to their fellow flock members.
            Watching them scratch the ground with their feet in search of food is a sight to behold.</p>

        <p>Did you know that chickens are also known for their motherly instincts? Hens diligently incubate their eggs,
            keeping them warm and protected until they hatch into adorable chicks. The bond between a mother hen and her
            chicks is heartwarming to witness.</p>
        <h2>General Biology and Habitat</h2>
        <p> Chickens are adaptable and can thrive in various environments, whether free-ranging on a farm or living in
            urban
            backyard coops. They provide sustainable benefits by consuming insects and weeds while also producing
            nutrient-rich fertilizer for gardens.</p>

        <p>In addition to their practical value, chickens bring joy and entertainment to many people. Their quirky
            behaviors
            and clucking sounds create a lively atmosphere in any setting. It's hard to resist smiling when observing
            their
            antics, like chasing after each other or dust bathing in the sun.</p>

        <p>In conclusion, chickens are remarkable creatures that offer more than just eggs and meat. They bring life and
            charm to farms and backyards, providing companionship, sustenance, and a glimpse into the wonders of the
            natural
            world.</p>
